Hackaton UPC 2023

This project is a web site named HouseMatch, which tries to show you the best adapted houses for your necessities.

To execute it you need to call fitxer.py and access to the web page given with the command: flask --app fitxer.py run  

We are studying AI bachelor degree, so we have decided to give a different approach and we have created our first html website.

This website consists in a house recomendator which should show similar houses to the one you have liked. 

We have managed to create the website and the algorithm, but we hasn't been able to apply the algorithm to our website.

The algorithm is implemented in code_link.py

On the other hand, we tried to get more data information for our project from the API, but we could't use it due to the large time of processing the full dataset. The idea we had for this part was to get the least common detections from images and shown the non common characteristics as if they were special. This is in a python notebook: api_data.ipynb
